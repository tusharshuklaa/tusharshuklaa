I'm a <strong>Senior Frontend Developer</strong> form <strong>INDIA 🇮🇳</strong>, working at [Publicis Sapient](https://www.publicissapient.com/). I am passionate about technology in general and am fascinated by complex challenges, user experience and design.

I'm a [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) fan, but also like working with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and sometimes [Angular](https://angular.io/) as well. I love to talk about web standards, performance and good coding practices and I'm very passionate about learning new things and using them for delivering better solutions.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a 2D Shooting game using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) just for fun-sake (will add the repo URL soon)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Angular from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) and targetting Flutter as next pitstop.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on asset creation for my Phaser game (game theme: COVID-19 😷)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with creating visually good images for my Phaser game
- 💬 Ask me about Typescript, React, Javascript, best coding practices and casual Indian stuff 😁
- 😎 Pronouns: he/him
- 📫 How to reach me: [@theTSguy](https://twitter.com/theTSguy)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a really hard remembering English spellings that contain 'e' and 'i' together 🙌 e.g. 'piece (auto-correct here 😅)'
